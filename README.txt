Project 2 - Daniel Castro and Zachary Andersen

For this project Daniel will be: 
- Creating the matrix to adjacency matrix converter.
- Setting collision for the enemies
- Making the enemy search algorithm.

For this project Zachary will be:
- Setting the player controls, movement, and collision
- Implemented ammo system for player
- Created save function

Contains: glut library, images for the game, 
Classes for: AdjList, CommonThings, Graph, Timer, Maze,
	     Walls, Enemies, Player, and saveGame.
The files are all linked in the main so the game simply runs
by executing the Maze application file. If this does not work
then one could use the Maze CBP with codeblocks then build
and run the file.
